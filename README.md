# Pong Game

## Synopsis
> Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games. 
## Gameplay
> The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
## Controls
```
[+] Player 1
>> Up = 'w'
>> Down = 's'

[+] Player 2
>> Up = 'Up arrow'
>> Down = 'Down arrow'

>> Pause = 'Enter'
>> Exit = 'Esc'
```

This is my version of the game made in C/C++, using the OpenGL graphics API and the GLUT toolkit. If you want to play, download the folder and simply open the `.exe` file.
Enjoy the game :3
